"""Solve-orchestration state types.

Foundation module: every downstream orchestration module (timeline,
recursive solve, stochastic, orchestration loop) needs the exception
classes, ``ActiveTimeEntry`` namedtuple, ``SolveResult`` dataclass and
a slim ``RunnerState`` carrier.  Runs natively on HiGHS via
``polar_high``; per-CLI flags live on the CLI wrapper rather than in
shared state.

    output processing can rewire the ``solve`` column and build a union

    The realized dispatch ``[period, timestep]`` and realized invest
    ``[period]`` are disjoint across solves by the rolling invariant

        preserved (solve order, then per-solve period/timestep order);
        the disjointness guard guarantees no ``(period, timestep)`` is
        contributed twice, so no de-duplication is needed.
    output_invest_timeline : list[str]
        Union over solves of the realized-invest periods (with the
        ``realized_periods`` fallback used by the per-solve writers),

        — the canonical ``[d,t] -> solve`` label map (roll key, matching

    period_to_solve_invest : dict[str, str]
