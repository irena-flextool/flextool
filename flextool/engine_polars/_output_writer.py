"""TIER A output writer adapter — Δ.1 dispatch.

Bridges the polars-build :class:`polar_high.Solution` to flextool's
existing post-solve writers in ``flextool.process_outputs``.  These
writers are the same code paths flextool uses today; we feed them the
live ``highspy.Highs`` instance the polars LP just produced + the work
folder so they read the support CSVs (``p_step_duration.csv``,
``process_block.csv``, …) that ``FlexToolRunner.write_input`` /
``preprocessing_solve_time`` are still emitting in the current cascade.

Rationale (from the Δ.1 design):

* ~50-100 LOC of glue beats a 700-LOC re-implementation of the writers.
* Variable-name reconciliation is the only friction point — the polars
  LP carries ``v_invest_p[<entity>,<period>]`` / ``v_invest_n[…]`` /
  ``v_divest_p[…]`` / ``v_divest_n[…]`` whereas flextool's writers expect
  unified ``v_invest[…]`` / ``v_divest[…]`` (option (ii) in the
  dispatch).  We resolve in-place by renaming the live HiGHS column
  names BEFORE delegating — `passColName` accepts a post-solve update,
  verified against highspy 1.x.  The rename is a no-op for variables
  already named correctly (most of them are).
* ``v_ramp`` is absent from the polars LP entirely — flextool's
  extractor handles "no matching columns" gracefully by emitting an
  empty-but-well-shaped parquet (see
  ``read_highs_solution.extract_variable``'s ``if not seen_cols``
  fallback).  No special-casing needed.

The carry-forward dependency is the support CSV cluster
(``p_step_duration.csv``, ``process_block.csv``, ``entity_block.csv``,
…) read by ``read_highs_solution._apply_block_expand`` /
``handoff_writers._load_*``.  Δ.2-Δ.10 retire those one cluster at a
time; Δ.1's job is to consume them via the writers, not to replace.

``periods_already_emitted`` carrier
-----------------------------------
``handoff_writers._bump_period_capacity`` accumulates this set on disk
into ``solve_data/period_capacity.csv``.  Δ.1 removed the in-memory
mirror that previously lived on :class:`SolveHandoff` and put it
where it belongs — :class:`OutputWriterState`, this module's
per-cascade scratch carrier.
