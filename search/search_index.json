To get you started, this how-to creates three different timelines: a full year, a 48h timeline and a timeline with five one-week periods to represent a full year. To be able to choose which of these are used in a given scenario, three alternatives are created: init, init_2day-test, init_5week-invest. </p> <p>The names of these alternatives hint at the intended use of each timeline. Even when you are building a large model with a long timeline, it is better to use a short 48 hour timeline for testing purposes when building the model. Using five one-week periods, i.e. \"a representative periods\", in an investment model is a method to reduce the model size and consequently solve time. More about that in How to run solves in a sequence (investment + dispatch)</p> <p></p> <p>To define a temporal structure for a model instance, you need to create the following entities:</p> <ul> <li><code>timeline</code> entity called y2020 with a map-type parameter <code>timestep_duration</code> that defines the timeline the time series data in the model will need to use. It contains, in the first column, the name of each timestep (e.g. t0001 or 2022-01-01-01) and, in the second column, the length of the timestep in hours (e.g. 1.0). The timestep names here must match the timestep names in other time series like <code>inflow</code> or <code>profile</code>. Here all of the three options use the same full year timeline i.e. timesteps from t0001 to t8760 with a step size of one hour.</li> <li><code>timeblockset</code> entities called full-year, 2day and 5week. Each of them need a map-type parameter <code>block_duration</code> to define a time block using a timestep name to indicate where the timeblock starts and a number to define the duration of the timeblock in timesteps: (t0001, 8760) for the full-year and (t4001 and 48.0) for the 48h. The timeline is larger than the 48 hours, but this way the solver uses 48 hours specified. The 5week needs five starting points t2521, t4538, t5041, t7057 and t8233 with all having the length of 168.0</li> <li><code>timeblockset</code> needs to be connected to the timeline. This is done by adding the <code>timeblockset__timeline</code> entities (full-year| y2020), (2day| y2020), (5weeks| y2020). </li> <li> <p><code>solve</code> entities called full-year-dispatch, 2day-dispatch and 5week-invest. In addition, they need the following parameters:</p> </li> <li> <p>a map-type parameter <code>period_timeblockSet</code> to define the timeblockset to be used by each period. Here each of the three use their <code>timeblockSet</code> to describe the same period p2020. The first column of the map has the period: p2020 and the second column the <code>timeblockSet</code>: full-year, 2day or 5week</p> </li> <li>an array-type parameter <code>realized_periods</code> to define the periods that are realised from the <code>solve</code> named by the entity (the first column of an array is an index number starting with 0, the second column contains the period to be realized in the results: p2020 for all the solves here)</li> <li> <p>a parameter <code>solve_mode</code>, to be set to single_solve in these examples</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, a <code>model</code> entity will define the solves to be included in a one model instance. They are defined in the array parameter <code>solves</code>. For these examples, the model name is flextool and for each <code>solve</code> the name of the <code>solve</code> should be given in the <code>solves</code> array (distinguished by the alternative): full-year-dispatch, 2day-dispatch or 5week-invest.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Be careful when choosing datatypes!

The nodes can pass energy to each other through a connection entity. This is often an electricity connection but it can be any form of energy (or matter)  moving between two nodes.

More at: How-to create a non-synchronous limit</li> <li><code>transfer_method</code>: Four options: regular (default), exact, variable_cost_only, no_losses_no_variable_cost. </li> </ul> <p>In most cases regular should be used. The downside of it is that it allows the flows to both directions at the same time, but the model does this only in specific circumstances when its beneficial to leak energy through the connection losses. For example, if connection capacity is 500 and efficiency 0.8, both nodes can send 500, but recive only 400 reducing the incoming energy by 100 in both nodes without any cost. Typically the model does not want to produce extra energy as it usually has costs, but it can happen if there is a cost to curtailing energy generation from a free source or if a unit is forced to generate at some level ('e.g. using <code>profile_method</code>: 'equal'). If <code>non-synchronous</code> constraint is used with a node using this connection, use exact instead as regular connections can circumvent this limit.</p> <p>Exact method does not allow flow in both directions at the same time, but it requires a binary variable, which will be computationally heavier (especially if the model would otherwise be fully linear). </p> <p>Variable_cost_only can be used when there are no losses associated with the flow. It allows costs related to the flow, but if losses are to be included, it should not be used.</p> <p>The no_losses_no_variable_cost can be used when the connection has no losses and no variable costs accociated with the flow. It is computationally the most efficient method, as it uses only one variable for the flow (the variable becomes negative for the other direction, but this can work only when there are no losses or variable costs). It also prevents simultanoues flow to both directions.</p> <p>The results of connections can be seen from the node_balance table. However, these are the results from all the connections connected to the node. If you want to have the results from an individual connection or specified connections, you can create a group of connection_nodes (<code>group_connection_node</code>) with a parameter <code>output_results</code> set to yes.

The inflow parameter accepts two types of data:</p> <ul> <li>Constant</li> <li>Timeseries map</li> </ul> <p>If the model is using multiple periods, then the same timeseries profile is used for every period. However, the inflow can be scaled for different periods with the <code>inflow_method</code> parameter: - <code>scale_to_annual_flow</code>: This will multiply the demand with a constant to make the summed inflow to match the <code>annual_flow</code>. This requires the node parameter <code>annual_flow</code> that is a map of periods containing the annual flow for each period. The sum of inflows is divided by the period's share of the year (hours in period /8760) before scaling (so that the annual energy demand/supply matches the <code>annual_flow</code> no matter what parts of the year are used to represent the full year).  - <code>scale_in_proportion</code>: calculates a scaling factor by dividing <code>annual_flow</code> with the sum of time series inflow (after it has been annualized using <code>timeline_duration_in_years</code>).

Then, a new reserve categories can be added (e.g. primary) to the <code>reserve</code> entity.  Finally, make sure there are up and down entities in the `UpDown' entity. These are hard-coded names in FlexTool and need to be used when creating reserves.</p> <p>Next, the reserve requirement will be defined. An entity between the <code>reserve__upDown__group</code> class (e.g. primary--up--electricity) allows to define the reserve parameters <code>reserve_method</code>, <code>reservation</code> (i.e. the amount of reserve) and <code>penalty_reserve</code> (i.e. the penalty cost in case of lack of reserve). For example, a constant of 10 MW could be used. Even though the name of the <code>reserve_method</code> is timeseries_only, it can also accept a constant value - it's an exogenous reserve requirement whereas the other two reserve methods are endogenous. Dynamic reserve method calculates the reserve requirement from generation and loads according to user defined factors (<code>increase_reserve_ratio</code>). Largest failure method will force enough reserve to cope with a failure of the chosen unit and connection flows.</p> <p>Parameters from the <code>reserve__upDown__unit__node</code> class should be used to define how different units can contribute to different reserves. Note that the entities in this class need to be added to the <code>Entity Alternative</code> sheet. Parameter <code>max_share</code> says how large share of the total capacity of the timestep (existing * efficiency * (profile)) of the unit can contribute to this reserve category (e.g. coal_plant may be limited by ramp constraint to provide only 1% of its capacity to an upward primary reserve.)

To demonstrate this, we have set a system with a coal plant, a wind plant and a single demand node. However, it can be done to a group of nodes with unlimited number of plants or connections connected. So, one can limit the non-synchronous share of individual nodes or of the whole system.

The existence of the non-synchronous penalty in your results indicates that this constraint has been violated and you should investigate the reason for this in your system.

This excludes the flows to and from the storage in the calculation of the non-synchronous ratio.

If it is non-synchronous, just set the connection parameter <code>is_DC</code>: yes.

It splits the problem into multiple consecutive smaller problems.</p> <p>The rolling window solve splits the time dimension into overlapping parts and solves each one of them separately but in a sequence (and can therefore pass state information from the previous solve to the next one). For example, instead of a solving the full year in one go, you can split the year into six four-month long solves where each solve outputs only the first two months. The solves would therefore include the months:</p> <ul> <li>Roll: Solve months -&gt; Output months</li> <li>1: [1,2,3,4] -&gt; [1,2]</li> <li>2: [3,4,5,6] -&gt; [3,4]</li> <li>3: [5,6,7,8] -&gt; [5,6]</li> <li>4: [7,8,9,10] -&gt; [7,8]</li> <li>5: [9,10,11,12] -&gt;[9,10]</li> <li>6: [11,12] -&gt; [11,12]</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The rolling solve could be setup also manually as described in the 'How to run a multi year model' - just using shorter periods. </p> <p>However, this would be tedious if there are many solves. In a rolling window model, the user can set the <code>rolling_jump</code> and <code>rolling_horizon</code> parameters, which are expressed in hours. </p> <ul> <li> <p><code>rolling_horizon</code>: sets the length of the whole solve, in hours. In previous example 4 months (2880 hours). Horizon allows the model to see bit further in the future to improve the decision making for the period that will be output.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>rolling_jump</code>: sets the interval for the length of each 'jump' the model takes forward in reach roll. It is then both the interval of roll starting points and the length of the output for each roll. The <code>rolling_jump</code> must be smaller than the <code>rolling_horizon</code>. In the previous example the <code>rolling_jump</code> would be 2 months (1440 hours).</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, the user can set the duration for how long the model will roll:</p> <ul> <li><code>rolling_duration</code>: Optional (hours), the length of combined rolls. In the example, it could be set to 8640 hours which would divide evenly, or 8760 hours which means that the last roll will be shorter than the others. It is nicer to use <code>rolling_jump</code> that is divisable with the <code>rolling_duration</code> to keep rolls even. If <code>rolling_duration</code> is not set, it defaults to rolling through the whole timeline.</li> </ul> <p>When using rolling window solve, you are solving the model with less information. Therefore, the results will be less optimal since the model will not have the full information at once. It is therefore important to know how this could affect the results and what things to consider when implementing a rolling window model. It will have an impact on time dependant parts of the model: for example, storages or cumulative flow constraints. If the model can see only a few months to the future, it can't see how much energy needs to be stored after that. </p> <p>Investments should not be used with this free rolling solve (<code>solve_mode</code>: rolling_window) as investments should only be done at the start of the periods. Both the long-term storage and the investments can be taken into account with nested rolling solves that have a separate how-to.</p> <p>Short term storages also are operated less optimally in a rolling window model. There is a positive side to this as well, since perfect foresight linear optimization models are 'too optimal'. They don't reflect the forecast errors present in real life. So, a rolling window model might operate a bit more realistically than a single_solve model. A single_solve model can consider things happening far in the future when setting the storage level at present, even though in reality that information is not available. So, the total cost of a rolling_window model should always be higher than the total cost from a complete single_solve model that has perfect information.</p> <p>To set a dispatch rolling window model you need to set the entity <code>solve</code> parameters:</p> <ul> <li><code>solve_mode</code>: rolling_window</li> <li><code>rolling_jump</code>: Hours, the desired length of the solve interval</li> <li><code>rolling_horizon</code>: Hours, the desired length of each roll solve</li> <li><code>rolling_duration</code>: (Optional) Hours, the length of the combined outputs. If not set, the whole timeline is used.</li> </ul> <p>Considerations on the rolling times:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>rolling_jump</code> and <code>rolling_horizon</code> must be large enough to make the model faster. If too small intervals are used, the creation of solves and moving data from solve to another might take too much time.</li> <li>If you are not using 1-hour timesteps, preferably use multiples of the timestep you are using as the <code>rolling_jump</code> and <code>rolling_horizon</code>. The steps included in each solve are calculated by summing the step durations until they are larger or equal to the hours given. So, if multiples are not used, the rolls might not be exactly the same size.</li> <li>The model can roll over timeblock and period jumps, which might cause some issues if storage constraints are used. Using timeblock length or its multiples is therefore recommended. For example, the <code>rolling_jump</code> could be a half of a timeblock and the <code>rolling_horizon</code> whole timeblock or <code>rolling_jump</code> a timeblock and <code>rolling_horizon</code> three timeblocks. Of course, when running e.g. a full year dispatch, there is only one timeblock of 8760 hours, which makes the choices more simple.</li> </ul> <p>Considerations on storage parameters:</p> <ul> <li><code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code> use_reference_value or use_reference_price are the preferred means to bind storage values. They can be used together with the <code>storage_state_start_end_method</code>: start, which would then set the initial storage state. These methods bind either the storage value or the storage price at the end of horizon (not the end of jump). This allows the storage to use the part of the horizon that is not output to improve the behaviour of the storage in the part that is output (as defined by <code>rolling_horizon</code> and <code>rolling_jump</code>). </li> <li><code>bind_within_timeblock</code> does not work correctly if the rolls don't include whole timeblocks. Instead, it will bind the first step of the roll (whatever it is) to the end of the timeblock. Do not use in nested solves if you are not using whole timeblocks or its multiples as <code>rolling_jump</code></li> <li>the same applies to the <code>bind_within_period</code> (but in relation to periods - do not use this unless you are <code>rolling_jump</code> is as long as a period or its multiples).</li> <li><code>storage_start_end_method</code> can be used to set the first timestep of the first roll and/or the last timestep of the last roll (in conjunction with <code>storage_state_start</code> and <code>storage_state_end</code>).</li> <li><code>bind_within_solve</code> binds the start state to the end state of each roll not the start and end of the whole model timeline.

If the model only sees a few weeks to the future, it really can't see how much energy should be stored in long term storages. Problems with investments can also be serious: If the first roll is really windy, the model would overinvest in wind power that is not profitable in the later rolls. Similarly, if the model is allowed to retire capacity, it might retire something that is actually needed in the later rolls. </p> <p>Nested solve sequences can first solve the investments and long-term storage levels and pass them to the dispatch solve. Both storage solve and dispatch solve can be rolling solves. The dispatch solves can then send the end storage values to the investment and long-term storage solves as start values to reduce the error of these solves.</p> <p>When to use nested solves?</p> <ul> <li>Dispatch model is taking too long to solve, but simple rolling window solve would not represent the long-term storages correctly.

(Three level nesting, graph below)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>However, the obvious issue is that investment and storage solves cannot be solved using the old complete solve as it wouldn't make the solve time any shorter. Therefore, we need to decrease the information for investment and storage solves as well. There are a few options for this:</p> <ol> <li>Use lower resolution (longer timesteps). This can work quite well for a long-term storage.</li> <li>Use representative periods from the full timeline when performing investments. There is a large body of literature and methods on how to pick the representative weeks.</li> <li>Split the investment timeline (myopic investments) by manually creating a solve sequence for the investment solves like in: How to create a multi-year model section. This can be combined with the first or second option. </li> </ol> <p>Each of these have their pros and cons:</p> <ul> <li>Using the lower resolution can speed-up the model considerably, but it also means that everything that happens faster than the new timestep duration will be lost as the timestep varying parameters are averaged or summed for the new timestep. For example, consider a model with investment options to solar and storage. If the step duration is changed to 24 hours, the model won't invest in enough storage to mitigate the diurnal variation in PV. When these investments are then passed to the dispatch solve, the invested portfolio will have trouble meeting the demand.</li> <li>Using the sample can be effective if the sample is chosen well, but all the needs that are not in these samples are not included. The speed is heavily dependent on the number and size of those samples.</li> <li>Splitting the investment timeline for multi-year models can be seen as a relatively realistic approach, since investment decisions would have a lot of uncertainty in the longer time frame anyway.</li> </ul> <p>The investment decisions with less information are always less optimal than with complete solves. Therefore, when they are passed to the dispatch solve, it will in some cases cause penalties in the results when the invested portfolio is not sufficient to meet the demand at all times.</p> <p>The long term storage solve can be implemented using a lower resolution solve. The storage state behaviour from the storage solve is used as a target for the dispatch solve. There are three options for doing this:  - fix_quantity creates a constraint that forces the end storage state to be the same as in the storage solve at this timestep. - fix_usage does the same but not taking into account the inflow or slacks. Forces the summed usage of the storage during the dispatch solve to be the same as during the same time span in the storage solve. This avoids infeasibilities when modelling inflow stochastics in comparison to the fix_quantity. - fix_price takes the dual marginal price from the storage solve at the end timestep of the dispatch solve and uses it in the objective function to give a value to the stored energy at the end of the horizon. </p> <p>The <code>rolling_jump</code> and <code>rolling_horizon</code> in the storage solve have to be longer than in the dispatch solve. You can set which storages are included as \"long term storages\" whose value will be transferred to the dispatch solve.</p> <p>To create a nested solve sequence, you need two or three <code>solve</code> entities. Either the investment solve or the storage solve can be left out. When using nested solve sequence, the sequence is not set with the <code>model</code>: <code>solves</code> parameter. Only the topmost solve is put there. Instead, the nested levels are set by the <code>solve</code> parameter <code>contains_solve</code>: solve_name. The investment solve is always on the top followed by the storage solve and dispatch solve:</p> <ul> <li>investment_solve <code>solve</code> parameter <code>contains_solve</code>: storage_solve_name </li> <li>storage_solve <code>solve</code> parameter <code>contains_solve</code>: dispatch_solve_name</li> </ul> <p>To create a storage solve:</p> <ul> <li><code>solve</code> parameter <code>fix_storage_period</code>: Array of periods where the storage values are fixed in the lower solve.

You don't want the dispatch results from this solve, but from the dispatch solve.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, the rolling dispatch solve should be created as in the How to use rolling window solve for dispatch. To set a dispatch rolling window model you need to set the entity <code>solve</code> parameters:</p> <ul> <li><code>solve_mode</code>: rolling_window</li> <li><code>rolling_jump</code>: Hours, the desired length of the solve interval</li> <li><code>rolling_horizon</code>: Hours, the desired length of each roll solve</li> <li><code>rolling_duration</code>: (Optional) Hours, the length of the combined outputs.

Each end of the horizon (not the output) has that value as well, which keeps the model from emptying the storages at the end of the roll. In the dispatch solve, the fixed storage value from the storage solve overrides the horizon end value if a conflict exist. </p> <p>How to create the three lower information solve types for investment and storage solves discussed above?</p> <p>To create a lower resolution (longer timesteps) solve:</p> <ul> <li>Make a new <code>timeblockSet</code>, but use the same <code>timeline</code> and <code>block_duration</code> for it as with the high resolution solve</li> <li>Set <code>timeblockSet</code> parameter <code>new_stepduration</code>: Hours</li> <li>In the <code>solve</code> use this new <code>timeblockSet</code> in the <code>period_timeblockSet</code></li> </ul> <p>The model will create a new timeline for this solve with the <code>new_stepduration</code>. All the timestep map data like <code>inflow</code> or <code>profile</code> will be either summed or averaged for the new timeline. Again, the <code>new_stepduration</code> should be multiple of the old step duration. If the <code>block_duration</code> is not a multiple of the <code>new_stepduration</code> the last timestep will be shorter than the rest. </p> <p>Note that if the last timestep of the dispatch horizon is not in the storage solve timeline, it will use the last available timestep to fix the storage. This can happen at the end of the timeline when the dispatch solve with a lower step size can fit an extra step after the last time step of the storage solve. Other reason might be that both dispatch and storage solves are aggregated with the <code>new_stepduration</code>. In that case, it is usually best to use values for the <code>new_stepduration</code> that are dividable.  </p> <p>To create a sample solve with representative periods:</p> <p>The tutorial contains an example of representaive periods under alternative 5weeks where the year is represented with five sample weeks. It is done with the <code>timeblockSet</code> parameter <code>block_duration</code> where instead of choosing the whole timeline by setting the first timestep and the duration of whole timeline, you choose multiple starting points with smaller durations. The example for the 5weeks is below.</p> <p></p> <p>To create an investment solve sequence, you have two options:</p> <ul> <li>Create manually a series of solves and set the <code>invest_periods</code> and <code>realized_invest_periods</code> individually for the solves. How to create a multi-year model has an example of this with the difference that here you use <code>realized_invest_periods</code> instead of <code>realized_periods</code> and that each of the higher level solves requires the <code>contains_solve</code> parameter. </li> </ul> <p>If you have many splits, this option can get tedious and prone to mistakes.</p> <p>The other option is to use only one investment <code>solve</code> entity:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>invest_periods</code> and <code>realized_invest_periods</code> should then be set with a 2D map where the first column tells the solve (you don't have to create separate <code>solve</code> entities for these) and the second column tells the period. To get a 2D map, choose the parameter type as Map and then right click the table and choose Insert column after/before. The value column does not matter. The model will generate these solves, with the periods given. Note that the solve names should match in both 2D-maps.  </li> </ul> <p>You can use the same lower level solve with each the investment solves as the lower level solves will exclude the periods that are not included in either of the upper level realized periods: <code>realized_invest_periods</code> or <code>fix_storage_periods</code>. So, the lower level solve should have all the periods that it is used for in any the solves.</p> <p></p> <p>Note that the results of a nested rolling solve run are not fully optimal, because the information in the model is decreased. This is the price you pay for the speed. Therefore, the results should not be taken as they are, instead it is important to know how to interpret the results: What phenomena are missing? How will they affect the results? Where should extra investments go to satisfy the demand (there is a possibility to use the <code>capacity_margin</code> method to force extra investments)?</p> <p>In the init.sqlite there are four example scenarios related to this:</p> <ul> <li>multi_fullYear_battery: The four period full year single solve, with coal, wind, battery storage with unlimited investment possibilities. Running this is still possible but takes a few minutes.

The main idea is to represent the distribution of possible futures by discrete scenarios (branches). These are all connected to the same starting point with the realized branch. A non-anticipatory constraint forces the branches to share the decisions that affect multiple timesteps with the realized branch during the realized part of the horizon. These decisions are investments, storage usage and online status of units. The model then optimizes the system to get the minimize the total cost all the branches (weighted by their probability). Only the realized timeline of the realized branch, will be output. The realized branch can continue to the end of the horizon (and be also a forecast) or just to the end of the realized part as in the picture.</p> <p></p> <p>For the stochastics to have an effect on the results, the system needs parameters that change between the stochastic branches. These could be e.g. wind power generation or fuel prices. The model will then have separate variables in every branch for all the decision the model can take (e.g. invesment, storage state, online, flow). As a consequence, the realization phase will also be dependent on the things that happen in the stochastic branches - weighted by the probablity given to each branch. Only one period investment stochastic models are supported currently.</p> <p>In this example, we show two ways to use stochastics: Single solve, rolling horizon. They all share the same test system that includes: </p> <ul> <li>A demand node </li> <li>Coal, gas and wind power plants </li> <li>Hydro power plant with a reservoir and a downriver nodes</li> </ul> <p>The demand and the downriver nodes have a constant negative inflow. Therefore, the hydro plant capacity is partly in use at all times. The varying timeseries are the wind profile and the water inflow the reservoir. The coal commodity is more expensive than the gas, so the system will try to use the reservoir water to minimize the usage of coal. This will be affected by the forecast of the wind and the forecast of the water inflow. These are the stochastic timeseries in these examples. </p> <p>You can have stochastics in multiple timeseries in the same solve, but these will have to share the branches. This means that for example if you have two wind plants with two different stochastic wind profiles with three branches (upper, mid and lower estimates) you need to think if it is best to use only three branches and put both of the upper estimates to the same 'upper' branch or should you use combinatorics to make nine branches. However, note that the tool will not do the combinatorics for you and the solving time will be heavily affected by extra branches. Consequently, the usual practice is to present all the stochastics using just e.g. three branches and consider the correlations between the stochastic parameters in the pre-processing of the input data.</p> <p>Notes about the storage options with stochastics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The best options to use are:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Storage_state_start_end_method</code>: fix_start or fix_start_end (and the their values)</p> </li> <li> <p><code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code>: fix_value or fix_price (and their values)</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not use any of the <code>storage_binding_methods</code>, they do not work correctly with stochastics (there is no unambigious end state that could circle back to the first time step). </p> </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"how_to/#single-solve-stochastics","title":"Single solve stochastics","text":"<p>(stochastics.sqlite scenario: 2_day_stochastic_dispatch)</p> <p>In this scenario, 24 hours are realized with an uncertain forecast for the next day. The timeblock length is therefore 48 hours and the branching will happen at the timestep t0025.  To set up a stochastic solve, we need three things: The stochastic branch information, the stochastic timeseries and choosing which parts of the model use stochastic timeseries.</p> <p>The information about the branches are set with the solve parameter <code>stochastic_branches</code>. This is a 4 dimensional map. (Edit -&gt; choose map -&gt; right click -&gt; add columns). The columns are: period, branch, analysis_time (starting time of the branch), realized (yes/no) and the value is the weight of the branch. Each starting time, including the first timestep, should have one and only one realized branch. This realized branch is used for the non-stochastic parts of the model with a stochastic timeseries. In this example we have three branches: mid, upper and lower representing the three wind forecasts. The weight will influence the relative weight of each branch in the objective function (model costs). The weights are normalized, so that the total weight is always one in each timestep.</p> <p>The stochastic wind timeseries are set with the same profile parameter <code>profile</code> but with a three dimensional map instead of the regular one dimesional map. The tool recognizes a stochastic timeseries from the dimensions of the data. The three dimensions are: branch, analysis_time and time. Here the realized part of the model (t0001-t0024) uses also the branch 'mid', which is one of the forecast branches as well. In the stochastic part, 'mid' is also set to be 'realized'. It is not actually realized (since the stochastic part is not realized), but it helps the model to choose which branch to use when there is no stochastic data available.</p> <p>The parts of the model that will use stochastic data is chosen with a group parameter <code>include_stochastics</code>. The units, nodes and connections that are added to this group use stochastic timeseries connected to them (if available). Here we add the unit wind_plant to this group. There is a possiblity that to have two wind plants with the same profile, but use the stochastics on only one of them. The other would then use only the realized branch.</p> <p>An option exists to output the stochastic horizons for debugging your system. This is done with the model parameter <code>output_horizon</code>. It will cause errors in the calculation of the cost in each solve (the costs of the unrealized branches will be included) so turn it off when you want the final results.</p> <p>If you change the weights of the stochastic branches, you should see the results change.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"how_to/#rolling-horizon-stochastics","title":"Rolling horizon stochastics","text":"<p>(stochastics.sqlite scenario: 1_week_rolling_wind)</p> <p>In this scenario we extend the previous timeline to one week and roll through it one day at a time with additional three day stochastic horizon:</p> <p>solve: <code>rolling_solve_jump</code> = 24 and <code>rolling_solve_horizon</code> = 96. </p> <p>The stochastic data should be given so that it can serve the rolling structure: <code>rolling_solve_jump</code> dictates the duration of the realized part of each solve and the interval of forecast updates. So, for every 'analysis_time' there needs to be a time series in each stochastic branch that extends to the end of horizon (as defined by <code>rolling_solve_horizon</code>).

A regular node maintains an energy/material balance between all inputs and outputs (<code>has_balance</code> set to yes). A storage node includes an additional state variable, which means that the node can also use charging and discharging of the storage while maintaining the energy balance. A storage node is created by setting <code>has_storage</code> to yes and by adding storage capacity using the <code>existing</code> parameter and/or by letting the model invest in storage capacity (<code>invest_method</code>, <code>invest_cost</code>, <code>invest_max_period</code> and <code>invest_max_total</code> parameters).</p> <p>Since FlexTool allows different temporal structures (multi-periods, rolling optimization, etc.) there needs to be ways to define how the storages behave when the model timeline is not fully consequtive. By default, storages are forced to match start level to the end level within timeblocks. This is an acceptable setting for small storages that do not carry meaningful amounts of energy between longer time periods in the model.</p> <p>There are three methods associated with storage start and end values: <code>storage_binding_method</code>, <code>storage_start_end_method</code> and <code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code>. </p> <ul> <li>The most simple one of these is the <code>storage_start_end_method</code> and it overrides the other methods, since it forces the start and/or the end state of the storage to a predefined value based on the proportional parameters <code>storage_state_start</code> and <code>storage_state_end</code> (proportional means that the parameter needs to be set between 0-1 and will be scaled by the storage capacity in the model). These two parameters affect only the first and the last timesteps of the entire model (even when the model has more than one solve).</li> <li><code>storage_binding_method</code> states how the storage should behave over discontinuities in the model timeline. Model timeline can have jumps for three different reasons: timeblocks, periods, and solves. If <code>storage_binding_method</code> is bind_within_timeblock, then the storage has to match the state of the storage between the beginning and the end of each timeblock. In effect, storage_state_at_start_of_timeblock equals storage_state_at_end_of_timeblock plus charging minus discharging minus self_discharge_loss at the last timestep. Similarly, bind_within_period will force the start and end between periods, but it will treat the jumps between timeblocks as continuous from the storage perspective (the storage will continue from where it was at the end of the previous timeblock). bind_within_solve does effectively the same when there are multiple periods within one solve. bind_within_model (NOT IMPLEMENTED 19.3.2023) will extend the continuity to multiple solves and force the end state of the storage at the end of the last solve to match the beginning state of the storage at the start of the first solve. Finally, bind_forward_only will force continuity in the storage state over the whole model without forcing the end state to match the beginning state.</li> <li><code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code> is meant for models that roll forward between solves and have an overlapping temporal window between those solves (e.g. a model with 36 hour horizon rolls forward 24 hours at each solve - those 12 last hours will be overwritten by the next solve). In these cases, the end state of the storage will be replaced by the next solve, but it can be valuable to have some guidance for the end level of storage, since it will affect storage behaviour. There are three methods: free is the default and will simply let the model choose where the storage state ends (usually the storage will be emptied, since it would have no monetary value). use_reference_value will use the value set by <code>storage_state_reference_value</code> to force the end state in each solve to match the reference value. use_reference_price will give monetary value for the storage content at the end of the solve horizon set by the <code>storage_state_reference_price</code> parameter - the model is free to choose how much it stores at the end of horizon based on this monetary value.</li> </ul> <p>-Method hierarchy:</p> <ol> <li><code>storage_start_end_method</code></li> <li><code>storage_binding_method</code></li> <li><code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code></li> </ol> <p>-Meaning:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>storage_binding_method</code> is ignored (exeption bind_forward_only), if <code>storage_start_end_method</code> has the value fix_start_end,</li> <li>The <code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code> use_reference_value is ignored, if other storage state methods are used.

Open IRENA FlexTool with Spine Toolbox (Open project..., navigate to the IRENA FlexTool and choose Ok). In other words, the IRENA FlexTool repository contains a Spine Toolbox project (in '.spinetoolbox' folder). A regular user is supposed to only change data in the Input_data and Results data stores as well as to choose scenarios to be executed in the arrows leaving these data stores. It is also possible to create your own workflow from the components provided in the '.spinetoolbox/specifications' folder. First, create a new project (in a new, separate, folder) and then, using the '+ From file...' button in the Spine Toolbox toolbar, add the workflow components you want. In this way, you are free to modify the workflow without affecting the git-controlled workflow from the IRENA FlexTool repository (that is modified by the developers). Please note, that the new project will then be in a different folder than the tool specifications, which will remain in the IRENA FlexTool repository folder and can be updated through git.</p> <p>If you are using the IRENA FlexTool browser-interface, then you will not directly see the Spine Toolbox workflow, but the FlexTool web-server will be executing parts of the workflow in the background as you develop and run the model.</p> <p></p> <p>The panel on the right shows the different <code>scenarios</code> that are available in the database.  The user can choose which scenarios will be processed by the workflow (until item Results,  which combines the results into one database). Spine Toolbox can execute scenarios in parallel  (as long as using 'work directories' is defined in FlexTool item).</p> <p>Input data workflow item points to a sqlite file that needs to have IRENA FlexTool data format  (that uses Spine Toolbox database definition). The template file has the right format and contains empty object classes corresponding to FlexTool data structure as well as parameters available  in each object class. Double clicking the Input data workflow item will open the database editor.  Just selecting the Input data workflow item allows one to change the file (make a copy of the  existing Input_data.sqlite using the file system of your OS and point to the copy).</p> <p>Init workflow item points to a sqlite file with predefined data that showcases IRENA FlexTool  functionality. Some of the scenarios from there are used in the user guide. Initialize  copies the contents of the Init database to the Input data database. The scenario filter in the arrow after the Init database can be used to choose what data will be copied.</p> <p>Export_to_csv workflow item is a Spine Toolbox exporter that has been set to write csv files that IRENA FlexTool model code will read.</p> <p>FlexTool workflow item contains a Python script that calls FlexTool model code for each solve  and passes data between these solves. FlexTool model is written in MathProg and it calls HiGHS  solver by default to solve the model. The outputs are csv files.</p> <p>Import_results is a Spine Toolbox importer that takes the output csv files and writes them  in the Results database.</p> <p>Excel_input_data and Import_from_Excel allow users to use Excel as an interface for the input data.  They are optional parts of the workflow.</p> <p>To_Excel worfklow item will export most scenario results to a simple Excel file. One way to utilize  this is by creating another Excel file that draws figures from the result Excel file that is then updated by the workflow.</p> <p>The browser interface of FlexTool also runs part of this same workflow  (Export_to_csv --&gt; FlexTool --&gt; Import_results).

This can be done from the <code>Entity Alternative</code> sheet. <code>Entity Alternative</code> chooses if the entity is part of the alternative or not. (If you are in 0.7 Toolbox, last update before 5/2024, this does not exist. Instead, use parameter <code>is_active</code>: yes)</p> <p></p> <p>Then, add parameter data to the newly minted west <code>node</code>: west node represents the demand in a part of the system.</p> <ul> <li>First add an <code>inflow</code> parameter with negative values to indicate negative inflow, i.e. demand.

This is tedious to do by hand, so you can also copy-paste this from the init database.</li> <li>There are no electricity generating units and the demand cannot be met by ordinary means. The model will therefore use the upward slack variable and accept the <code>penalty_up</code> cost associated with it. This represents the cost of not fulfilling the demand. Also downward <code>penalty_down</code> is defined although the model is not using it at this stage. Here values of 9000 and 8000 are used respectively. By default the model uses the value 10 000 for these. Therefore, it is not mandatory to set them, but sometimes these values need to be changed, so understanding how they work is nessesary.</li> <li>Penalties and slack variables are tools of linear optimization. They ensure that the problem is feasable at all timesteps even when the in-out-balance of the nodes is violated. If no real penalty values are known, one should just use large enough numbers, so that the system won't prefer penalty to energy production. In the results, you can see at which timesteps the penalties are used.</li> <li>The parameter <code>has_balance</code> is related to this and should be set to yes. It forces the node to have a balance on inflow and outflow. If the demand is not fulfilled, balance is forced by the slack variable that will \"create\" the energy with the penalty associated with it. </li> <li>All parameters here should be part of the west <code>alternative</code> (column alternative_name) - they will be used whenever a <code>scenario</code> includes the west <code>alternative</code>.
