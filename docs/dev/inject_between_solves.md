# Injecting parameters between solves

Reference for the programmatic `override_provider` hook on
[`run_chain_from_db`][rc]. This is the supported mechanism for feeding
data from an external tool — another optimisation model, a market
simulator, a Python data step — into a FlexTool cascade *between*
sub-solves of the same run.

[rc]: ../../flextool/engine_polars/_orchestration.py

## Purpose

A FlexTool cascade runs several sub-solves in sequence; each one passes
a typed `SolveHandoff` (realised investments, end-of-horizon storage
state, cumulative emissions, …) to the next. The override hook lets a
Python wrapper substitute values for any of those handoff carriers
*before* the next sub-solve's preprocessing reads them.

Typical wrappers:

- An outer model in a bi-level setup writes a Parquet file with target
  capacities; the wrapper reads it and overrides `realized_invest`.
- A market simulator runs between two operational solves; the wrapper
  feeds an updated `cumulative_co2` or `cumulative_commodity` ladder
  into the second solve.
- A Python data step rewrites end-of-horizon storage state from an
  observed (rather than optimised) trajectory to validate roll-forward
  behaviour.

The mechanism is programmatic only — there is no CLI flag. The wrapper
script imports `run_chain_from_db` and passes a callable.

## API

```python
from flextool.engine_polars import run_chain_from_db

run_chain_from_db(
    input_db_url,
    scenario_name=None,
    work_folder=None,
    *,
    override_provider=None,  # Callable[[], dict[str, pl.DataFrame]] | None
    ...,
)
```

The `override_provider` callable takes no arguments and returns a dict
mapping a whitelisted `K.HANDOFF_*` constant to a `polars.DataFrame`.
It is invoked **once per sub-solve iteration**, after the natural
handoff translators and before preprocessing. Returning `{}` (or
`None`) means "no override this iteration".

Full source: `flextool/engine_polars/_orchestration.py` (entry point),
`flextool/engine_polars/_native_run_model.py` (invocation site),
`flextool/engine_polars/_provider_translators.py`
(`translate_overrides_to_provider`, `read_handoff_frame`,
`dump_provider_sources`).

## Whitelisted handoff keys

Only the 11 keys below are overridable. Supplying any other key raises
`ValueError` in `translate_overrides_to_provider`. The constants live
in `flextool.engine_polars._provider_keys`; import as
`from flextool.engine_polars import _provider_keys as K`.

| Key constant | What it overrides | Required columns |
|---|---|---|
| `K.HANDOFF_REALIZED_INVEST` | Realised investment decisions carried into the next solve's "previously invested capacity" | `entity, period, value` |
| `K.HANDOFF_REALIZED_EXISTING` | Realised existing (non-decision) capacity adjustments | `entity, period, value` |
| `K.HANDOFF_DIVEST_CUMULATIVE` | Cumulative divestments carried forward | `entity, value` |
| `K.HANDOFF_ROLL_END_STATE` | End-of-horizon storage state (downward roll) | `node, value` |
| `K.HANDOFF_UPWARD_ROLL_END_STATE` | End-of-horizon storage state (upward roll) | `node, value` |
| `K.HANDOFF_CUMULATIVE_CO2` | Cumulative CO2 per group/period for the next emission cap | `group, period, value` |
| `K.HANDOFF_CUMULATIVE_COMMODITY` | Cumulative commodity-ladder realised MWh | `commodity, tier, period, p_ladder_cum_realized_mwh` |
| `K.HANDOFF_CUM_SIM_HOURS` | Cumulative simulated hours per period (commodity ladder denominator) | `period, p_ladder_cum_sim_hours` |
| `K.HANDOFF_FIX_STORAGE_QUANTITY` | Fixed storage quantity at specific steps | `node, period, step, p_fix_storage_quantity` |
| `K.HANDOFF_FIX_STORAGE_PRICE` | Fixed storage price at specific steps | `node, period, step, p_fix_storage_price` |
| `K.HANDOFF_FIX_STORAGE_USAGE` | Fixed storage usage at specific steps | `node, period, step, p_fix_storage_usage` |

The column shapes match the empty-frame schemas in
`_provider_translators._HANDOFF_EMPTY_SCHEMAS`; the `value` columns are
read as `Utf8` and cast on consumption (the legacy CSV-roundtrip
contract). Building the frame as numeric `Float64` also works — polars
casts on the consumer side. Match the natural handoff carrier's schema
if in doubt; the easiest pattern is to start from a captured
`SolveHandoff.<field>` frame and transform it (see the example below).

## Lifecycle

At the start of each sub-solve iteration, the orchestrator runs the
following steps in order:

1. **Sequential handoff translation.** The previous sub-solve's
   `SolveHandoff` is fanned into `handoff/*` Provider keys
   (`translate_handoff_to_provider`).
2. **Parent handoff translation.** In nested cascades, the parent's
   handoff is translated next.
3. **Override callable.** If `state.override_provider` is non-`None`,
   it is invoked. The returned dict is fanned into the parallel
   `override/*` Provider keys
   (`translate_overrides_to_provider`).
4. **Preprocessing.** Per-solve preprocessing reads handoff values via
   `read_handoff_frame`, which checks the `override/*` slot first and
   falls back to `handoff/*`. Consumers stay key-stable.
5. **Solve.** The LP is built (cold) or updated (warm) and dispatched
   to the solver.

The callable is invoked **on every iteration** including the first.
Return `{}` whenever no override applies — that iteration falls through
to the natural handoff carrier with no Provider writes and no log
output. If the callable raises, the exception propagates and the
cascade aborts; clean error handling is the wrapper's responsibility.

Each invocation that returns a non-empty dict logs at INFO::

    [override] applied N keys at iter=I solve=SOLVE_NAME

with the sorted key list at DEBUG.

## Warm-path interaction

Under `--warm`, the warm `Problem` for iteration N is built from the
previous iteration's LP coefficients and is reused *before* the
override callable fires for iteration N. Concretely:

- Overrides at iteration N **do not** retroactively mutate the warm LP
  matrix entering iteration N. They affect only what preprocessing
  computes downstream of `read_handoff_frame`.
- For example, overriding `K.HANDOFF_REALIZED_INVEST` at iteration N
  changes `p_entity_previously_invested_capacity` (and anything
  computed from it) for iteration N's preprocessing, but the warm LP
  coefficients still reflect iteration N-1's value of
  `realized_invest`.

If the wrapper needs the override to influence the LP matrix itself,
run the cascade cold (omit `warm=True`).

## Audit

Set `FLEXTOOL_AUDIT_SOURCES=1` (see [Environment variables](env_vars.md))
to enable the per-sub-solve audit dump. Every Provider key written with
a non-`None` `source` tag is appended to
`<work_folder>/audit_sources.log` as one tab-separated line per write::

    <solve_name>\t<provider_key>\t<source_tag>

Override writes carry the tag `external_override` and the key prefix
`override/`. Useful for confirming the wrapper fired on the iterations
it was meant to (and didn't fire on the ones it wasn't).

## Example wrapper

A wrapper script that reads override frames from a directory of
Parquet files. Each file is named `<scenario>__<solve_name>.parquet`
and contains a single override frame for `realized_invest`. Files that
don't exist are treated as "no override for that iteration".

```python
"""Run a FlexTool cascade with realized_invest overrides supplied
by an external tool that drops Parquet files into a watch directory.

Usage:
    python run_with_overrides.py path/to/input.sqlite scenario_name
"""

Set `FLEXTOOL_AUDIT_SOURCES=1` when running this to verify the
override fired on the expected iterations.

## Security

The override callable is arbitrary Python supplied by the wrapper
author. Whoever invokes `run_chain_from_db` already has full Python
execution privileges in the same process, so the override hook
introduces no new injection surface — anything the callable could do,
the wrapper script itself could already do. The 11-key whitelist
constrains *what cascade state* the returned dict can substitute, not
*what code can run inside the callable*. No `eval` / `exec` /
`importlib` machinery is involved on the FlexTool side; the callable
is just invoked with `()` and its return value is consumed.

If you are integrating FlexTool into a service that accepts untrusted
input, the trust boundary is the wrapper around `run_chain_from_db`
itself, not this hook.
