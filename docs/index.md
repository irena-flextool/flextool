IRENA FlexTool is an energy systems optimisation model developed for power and energy systems with high shares of wind and solar power. It can be used to find cost-effective sources of flexibility across the energy system to mitigate the increasing variability arising from the power systems. It can perform multi-year capacity expansion as well as unit commitment and economic dispatch in a user-defined sequence of solves. The aim has been to make it fast to learn and easy to use while including lot of functionality especially in the time scales relevant for investment planning and operational scheduling of energy systems.
