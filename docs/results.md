# Results

FlexTool outputs results typical to a planning model or a scheduling model, but it also tries to highlight potential flexibility issues in the system. The outputs from the latest run are initially CSV files and can befound in the folder 'output'. File 'summary_solve.csv' can give a quick overview of potential issues in the solve - it is a diagnostic file. The other files are all numerical results and will be imported to a Spine database by the FlexTool workflow.
