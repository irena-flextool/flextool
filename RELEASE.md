## Release 3.39.0 (19.5.2026) — `enum dtype` refactor + cascade perf

Built on 3.38.0.  Completes the `enum dtype` refactor (Phase 0 → 4.9
plus the `polar_high` companion) so that every cascade axis-aware
column carries a polars `Enum` dtype end-to-end.  The refactor +
follow-on perf work delivers a ~98 % reduction in per-loader cascade
memory and a ~9× speed-up in `input_derivation.run` on the H2_trade
test_24h fixture (the canonical large-fixture diagnostic).

**Phase 4 enum dtype refactor (final pass — 4.7d → 4.9)**
- 4.7d: `align_join_dtypes` adoption sweep + `_load_edd_history`
  consumer audit
- 4.7e: Pattern 5 `lit_axis` for `fill_null` on axis-aware columns
  (`input.py` block-compat joins)
- 4.7f: relax mixed-vocab `n` → `e` in `flow_to_n` / `flow_from_n`;
  restore axis types post-Utf8 compare for `d`/`b` cross-Enum filter
- 4.8a: structural Enum-typing in `_inflow_scaling`
  `pbt_node_inflow` producer/fold (dict-LazyFrames now declare
  explicit Enum schema)
- 4.8b: `schema_dtype(...)` in empty-frame fallbacks across
  `_solve_context.py` and writer modules — empty + populated frames
  now agree on dtype under activation
- 4.8c: `block` axis vocab `key_kind: "values_plus_default"`
  substrate fix (scalar-per-entity `new_stepduration` was returning
  empty vocab); cascade `block_coarse → "bk"` cascade fix; together
  clear 84 lh2_three_region failures
- 4.8d: defensive `d` / `t` Enum re-cast at `p_profile_value_lf`
  entry — stochastic dt_lf paths cleared 25+ `derived_e` failures
- 4.8e: defensive d/t re-cast across `_derived_arithmetic`,
  `_derived_branch`, `_inflow_scaling`, `_derived_params`,
  `_projection_params`, `_derived_block` — 22 sites
- 4.8f: `cast_frame_axes` at cascade-helper entry — 17 sites
- 4.8g: cross-Enum `is_in` semi-join in `model.py` + `_direct_params`
  entry cast
- 4.8h: `model.py` cross-Enum `is_in → semi-join` sweep across
  18 sibling sites
- 4.8i: cross-Enum-different-vocab join fixes for wind_battery /
  lh2 / network_coal_wind_reserve (`model.py` per-Var down-casts
  reading target dtype from the FlexData schema, since
  `_LIVE_AXIS_ENUMS_CTX` was empty inside `build_flextool`)
- 4.9 (substrate): `polar-high-opt` ships `_align_enum_join_keys` —
  a generic subset-aware up-cast helper invoked at every internal
  join site in `polar_high/engine.py`.  Cascade can now drop ~25
  per-Var down-cast lines in `model.py`; the DSL stays unchanged.
  Documented in `polar-high-opt/README.md` "Enum dtype handling"
  section + 12 new tests in
  `polar-high-opt/tests/test_enum_dtype_align.py`

**Cascade performance (perf-fix follow-on)**
- `SpineDBBackend.parameter_value` cache:
  `find_parameter_values(class=, param=)` under spinedb-api's
  scenario filter scales with the in-memory parameter_value table
  (~1.85 s per call on H2_trade), not with filter selectivity.  One
  bulk `find_parameter_values()` (~2.7 s for ~25 k rows) + Python
  partition into `{(class, param): [rows]}` replaces ~100 individual
  filtered calls in `input_derivation.run`.  **~60× speed-up** on
  the parameter-fetch hot path.  Cache is lazy per-backend-instance,
  invalidated on `close()`.
- Columnar `_unroll_rows` in `SpineDbReader`: replaced the
  row-of-dicts → `pl.DataFrame(out_rows)` pattern (~503 ms on the
  hot `profile/profile` param) with `dict[str, list]` →
  `pl.DataFrame(columns, schema_overrides=…)` (~58 ms).  Recursion
  uses a positional `idx_path` mutated via append/pop, eliminating
  per-recursion `dict(base)` copies.  Tolerant of mixed-type Map
  indexes via `strict=False` + per-leaf last-wins consolidation in
  `_emit_leaf`.  **~10 % per-parameter speed-up** end-to-end
- Persist `_LIVE_AXIS_ENUMS_CTX` past `load_flextool`'s return so
  cascade helpers calling `cast_dim(..., None, axis)` see the live
  enum vocabulary inside `build_flextool` (substrate-level fix that
  unblocked `_delay.py:324` and several latent cross-Enum joins)
- Forward `provider=` through `apply_derived_f`'s three
  `*_from_workdir` calls — restores the multi-solve handoff chain
  (`p_entity_all_existing` accumulates correctly across sub-solves)

**Measured wins on H2_trade test_24h (vs 2026-05-13 baseline)**
- `cascade_start`: 276 MB → 276 MB (parity)
- `input_derivation.run` wall-clock: **33 s → 25.9 s (~21 % faster)**
- Per-loader cascade ΔRSS: **~950 MB → ~21 MB (~98 % reduction)**:
  `_load_node` -99 %, `_load_process_topology` -96 %,
  `_load_varcost` -99 %, `_load_profiles` -32 MB
- Broadcast cascade (`write_workdir_inputs_end →
  first_load_flextool_end`): +2.2 GB growth in baseline → **−0.8 GB
  drop** here
- 631-test gate: ~23 s → ~17 s (incidental)

**Cascade robustness**
- `seed_provider_from_dir` is now tolerant of malformed
  `solve_data/*.csv` files — stray dev artefacts with bad headers
  no longer block the whole loader; a warning is logged per skipped
  file
- Numeric-column → Enum cast guard at SpineDBBackend +
  SpineDbReader emit boundaries: polars' numeric → Enum cast
  reinterprets values as positional indices into the enum's
  categories; the guard skips the cast for numeric source columns
  (which are never dim columns under the contract)
- `polar_high` (3.39.0-companion): defensive `if nm is not None:`
  guard on `h.passRowName(i, nm)` mirrors the existing col-name
  guard — null row names from `pl.format(...)` on null axis columns
  no longer crash highspy

**Test suite**
- **Retired** `tests/engine_polars/test_db_direct_parity.py` (~95 %
  of its 981 tests were CSV-vs-DB-direct migration scaffolding —
  the migration is established).  Salvaged 45 survivor tests into
  `tests/model/test_db_direct_solve_parity.py`: the LP-solve-vs-
  parquet-objective parametric matrix, `InMemoryReader` /
  `load_flextool` entry-point edge cases, `test_resolved_default_landed`
  default matrix, and seven literal-value singletons.  37 pass; 4 of
  the 6 remaining failures fixed mid-session (see "Bug fixes" below);
  the 4 leftover failures are documented in `specs/model_bugs.md`
  (two pre-existing LP-objective baseline issues, two stochastic
  period-vocab cascades — none are enum-pattern fixes)

**Bug fixes (parity-test survivors)**
- `_delay.py:324` cross-Enum compare: substrate ContextVar
  persistence (Fix 1 — see above)
- `apply_derived_f` missing `provider=` forwarding to three
  `*_from_workdir` handoff loaders (Fix 3 — pre-existing bug from
  commit `5f9c50809a` 2026-05-05, surfaced now)
- polar_high defensive `passRowName` guard (Fix 2 — masks but does
  not fix the underlying stochastic period-vocab gap; tracked in
  `specs/model_bugs.md::PARITY-3`)
- Mixed-type Map indexes regression from columnar refactor
  (commit `a98caa1c`) — `strict=False` on the two
  `pl.DataFrame(columns, schema_overrides=…)` call sites + last-wins
  consolidation in `_emit_leaf` for duplicate index-column names

**Documentation**
- `specs/memory_diagnostic_results.md` — appended "Post-perf-fix
  re-measure (2026-05-19 — commit `e6797b17`)" section with the
  numbers above
- `specs/model_bugs.md` — added PARITY-1/2/3 (3 LP-objective parity
  failures with legacy-trust discussion), RESERVE-1 (`prundt`
  populator missing on `fullYear_roll`), ARITH-1
  (`flow_upper_rhs * p_process_availability` Utf8 leaf on
  `test_a_lot`), REGRESS-1 (FIXED), PERIODS-1 (`_solve_periods`
  expects `"i"` column that `examples.sqlite::invest_5weeks` doesn't
  produce), and TASK COVERAGE-1 (add automated e2e for three
  `examples.sqlite` scenarios that surfaced four of the bugs above
  — fixture data already in place, pure test-wiring)

## Release 3.38.0 (18.5.2026) — Rivendell bug-fix suite

Built on 3.37.0's in-memory cascade. Fixes a cluster of regressions that surfaced on the Rivendell customer database after the cascade rewrite, plus a final round of test ports.

**This release is the last known-stable point before the in-flight `enum dtype` refactor (Phase 0 → 4.8); pin to 3.38.0 until that lands green.**

**Bug fixes**
- Rivendell bug 1+5+6: `engine_polars/scaling.user_bound_scale` recommendation is now column-only (a previous row+col recommendation collapsed solver progress on S17/B0)
- Rivendell bug 2 / BUG A2: `engine_polars` casts `user_constraints` coefficients to Float64 — previously left as int when authored as integer, breaking polars joins downstream
- Rivendell bug 3: `co2_price` shape probing uses value-domain inspection instead of column count when the shape is ambiguous
- Rivendell bug 4: regression test added for the `process_online_dt` UC column carry
- BUG A1: `blocks` + output writer route input/block reads through the Provider so they observe in-memory writer output rather than a stale on-disk snapshot
- BUG A3: `process_outputs.process_source_sink_varCost` keyed by `alwaysProcess` (previously dropped rows for processes that only exist in some subsolves)
- BUG A4 / A2-followup: branch-weight Provider-routed read + 1000× cap-margin restored on the cascade scaling/state path; provider threaded into cascade scaling/state helpers
- BUG B1: cascade fans rolling-ladder accumulators back into the FlexData Provider on each roll so per-roll cumulative quotas no longer drift
- BUG B2: MATPOWER → Spine converter sets `node_type=commodity` on the per-generator fuel nodes it synthesises (previously emitted with the default type, breaking `node_balance_eq` on imported MATPOWER cases)
- BUG `p_online_dt_empty_no_blocks`: `p_online_dt_set` falls back correctly when UC is enabled but no `process_block` is authored

**Test infrastructure**
- `tests/perturbation/*` ported to the native cascade harness
- `tests/emission/*` ported to polar_high `Problem` inspection (the underlying MPS-emission path was retired in Δ.22)
- Solver license probe at startup is skipped under test to silence the Xpress `LicenseWarning` on CI
- `tests/model`: invest-chain regression test (Pre-work 0b R1+R2) + LP-bound-range smoke for invest + `work_base` (Pre-work 0b R7)

## Release 3.37.0 (17.5.2026) — In-memory cascade (FlexData Provider/Accumulator + package refactor)

This release retires the on-disk CSV round-trip that previously sat between every cascade stage. FlexData is now built, threaded, and consumed entirely in memory across the loader, writers, solver, and output writers. `--csv-dump` is the only path that still emits the intermediate CSVs (for debugging / GUI inspection); the production path keeps everything in `polars.DataFrame` form.

Two new packages factor the cascade I/O surface: `spinedb_backend` (Spine DB → FlexData), and `input_derivation` (preprocessing derivations that previously lived in `flextoolrunner/preprocessing/*`). `flextoolrunner/preprocessing/*` and `flextoolrunner/input_writer.py` are deleted.

**FlexData Accumulator (Phases C–H)**
- Phase C: per-sub-solve `FlexDataAccumulator`
- Phase D: `load_flextool(seed=FlexDataAccumulator)`
- Phase E (a–j): cascade consumes accumulator via `seed=`; 8 batches of monolith-writer "lifts" so writers populate the accumulator rather than emit CSVs (`_writer_arc_unions`, `chain_params` + `co2_accumulators`, `_writer_pdt_params`, `_writer_period_params`, `dispatchers` + `calc_params`, the remaining 4 monolith writers, `_writer_solve_writers`, `period_calc` + `per_solve` + `reserve`); `--csv-dump` gating; cross-solve carriers lifted into `capture_frames`; seed-aware `csv.reader` + `path.exists()` audits in writer + loader modules; fixes for Rivendell `B0_base_hourly_rp` and `S08_co2cap_slice` regressions surfaced by the lift
- Phase C.5: slimmed `OrchestrationStep` with `keep_solutions` opt-in
- Phase F: parquet-bundle registry + `manifest.json` for hand-off between sub-solves
- Phase G: `process_outputs` disk reads migrated to in-memory kwargs
- Phase H: end-to-end verification pass

**FlexData Provider (Step 1 + Step 2 + Step 2.5)**
- Step 1-a → 1-g-7f: `FlexDataProvider` scaffolding; pilot migration of `_read_p_flow_max`; full migration of `input.py`, writer-side reads, `process_outputs` reads; Provider-exclusive writer population; per-writer `provider=` threading through `_writer_per_solve`, `_writer_period_calc`, `_writer_inflow_scaling`, `_writer_dispatchers`, `_writer_lp_scaling`, `_writer_chain_params`, `_writer_arc_unions`, `_writer_solve_time`, `_solve_context`, `_pdt_lookup`, `_derived_params`, `_derived_profile`
- Step 2a–c: deleted the seed funnel + transitional shims; rewired `--csv-dump` and removed the CSV-emission gate
- Step 2.5-E (Phases A+B+C): Provider through the timeline + averaged-timeseries cascade
- Meta-test for post-Step-2 cascade invariants
- Tighter `RAW_INPUT_FALLBACK_ALLOWLIST` after the disk-arm purge; meta-guard against new disk fallbacks creeping in

**Disk-fallback purge**
- Disk-fallback arms deleted from 12 writer modules: `_provider_open`, `_provider_lookup_positional`, `_derived_params`, `_invest_seeds`, `_dc_power_flow` + `_commodity_ladder`, `_derived_profile`, `_delay`, `_reserve`, `_group_slack`, `_derived_branch`, `_derived_existing`, `_timeline`, `_inflow_scaling`
- `_load_handoff_aux_pair` callers fixed; `path.open` retired in the same area
- `flextoolrunner/blocks` routes `write_block_data` through `_PATCH_MODULES`
- Test verification: workdir-empty smoke + `--csv-dump` round-trip

**`input_derivation` package**
- Skeleton package created; validators extracted to `_validators` submodule
- Ported derivations: `_write_process_method`, `_write_dc_power_flow_data`, commodity ladders + ladder_sets — all now in-memory
- `run()` entry point introduced; `write_input` rewired through it; `write_workdir_inputs` routes through `input_derivation` directly
- `flextoolrunner/preprocessing/*` and `flextoolrunner/input_writer.py` deleted (superseded)

**`spinedb_backend` package**
- Skeleton package + entity / parameter / default materialisers
- `_ENTITY_SPECS`, `_PARAMETER_SPECS`, `_DEFAULT_VALUES_SPECS` migrated onto `Backend.entities` / `Backend.parameter_values` / `Backend.parameter_defaults`
- Provider threaded into `write_input`, `_writer_leaf_sets`, `_writer_mid_sets`, `_writer_calc_params`
- `flextoolrunner` plumbs Provider through `solve_writers.write_all_branches`, averaged-timeseries, and `timeline_config.py` disk read

**In-memory region decomposition (item 2.6)**
- `flextoolrunner` region decomposition is now fully in-memory across all entry points

**Tests migrated to native cascade**
- Migrated: `test_commodity_ladder_smoke`, `test_commodity_ladder_rolling`, `test_years_represented`, `test_timings_csv`, `TestPGLibCase14Integration`, `test_cost_aggregation_semantics`, `test_non_anticipativity`, `test_lh2_three_region`, `test_obj_decomposition`
- Retired: `test_mps_parity.py` deleted (legacy MPS parity dead); `tests/emission/*` skipped (`flextool.mps` emission gone in Δ.22 — ported to polar_high in 3.38.0); perturbation/* skipped (harness incompatible — ported in 3.38.0); `test_solve_handoff.py` trimmed (9 retired PoC tests dropped)
- `test_integration_parquet_matches_csv_on_base_scenario` skipped (legacy parquet/CSV parity is no longer meaningful)

**Miscellaneous**
- Commodity ladder reads routed through the Provider
- `apply_npv` signature mismatch fixed; provider threaded
- `engine_polars/scaling`: geometric-midpoint `user_bound_scale` + 6-decade gate
- GUI: Debug checkbox passes `--debug --csv-dump` to scenario runs
- Dropped redundant `_native_leaf_set_override` in `_drive_cascade`
- `engine_polars`: ported `co2_max_total` + fixed `minimum_downtime` invest tightening
- `read_parameters`: densified `reserve_upDown_group_reservation` to LP domain
- `process_outputs` / `read_variables`: stream parts via `ParquetWriter` row-groups

## Release 3.36.0 (15.5.2026) — Output-writer hardening + LP determinism + Surface A audit

Hardening release. The `engine_polars` cascade is pinned to a deterministic HiGHS solve and the LP column/row ordering is now canonical, so re-runs and goldens are stable across `PYTHONHASHSEED` and across CI workers. Many `process_outputs` regressions surfaced during the polars-cascade adoption are fixed; golden CSVs that drifted on the glpsol→HiGHS transition are regenerated with REGEN_LOG documentation. Surface A loader audit lands 50+24+13 focused tests.

**LP determinism**
- `engine_polars/scaling`: pin HiGHS to deterministic simplex options
- Canonical LP column/row ordering via `add_var` / `add_cstr` wrappers
- Post-`unique()` set frames sorted before LP id assignment
- `engine_polars` keys `_all_steps` by per-roll solve name, not parent solve
- `tests/db_utils`: numeric columns cast to float in `round_for_comparison`
- `assert_frame_equal` gains `atol=1e-4` to absorb the rounding step
- `scaling._scale_cache` cleared between scenarios in tests
- Two scenarios' `time_budget` bumped to absorb the determinism overhead (incl. `wind_battery_invest_lifetime_renew_4solve` 4.0 → 6.0 s)

**Output writers (`process_outputs`)**
- `costs_discounted`: multi-roll inflation/lifetime values now correct
- `dtt` MultiIndex sorted by `(solve, period, time, t_previous)`
- Per-period `years_represented` threaded through `FlexData`
- `d_realize_invest` filtered to realized periods only; divest periods included
- `summary_solve.csv`: solve names natural-sorted; Investment discount factor written over `period_in_use`
- `VRE_potential` + `group_flows` CSVs restored after a regression
- `process__ct_method` built from `process_min_load_eff`
- `dt_realize_dispatch` / `d_realized_period` use `realized_dispatch`
- `unit_capacity__d.csv` lag in rolling solves fixed
- `(entity, period)` lookups filtered to `v.invest`'s actual index
- `par` / `s` unioned over `full_dt` for rolling/multi-solve
- Self-discharge multiply fixed on rolling/multi-solve scenarios
- `unit__{input,output}Node` wide-pivot columns sorted
- Both flow directions emitted for direct-method arcs
- `commodity_node` sets derived from FlexData `flow_*` frames
- `nodeGroupDispatch` arc-union sets backfilled for `group_flows`
- Sub-femto HiGHS LP residuals clipped in `out_flows` before CSV emit
- Native engine + `process_outputs` fix for nested invest+dispatch cascades
- Rolling-storage hand-off fix for non-forward-only storages
- Forecast-branch rows emitted when `output_horizon=yes`
- Reserve None-handling hardened; `process_reserve` column emission gated on scheduled reservation
- `calc_group_flows`: `.squeeze()` dropped — was crashing single-timestep solves
- `engine_polars`: detects period column under user-renamed `Map.index_name`

**Goldens regenerated (HiGHS-clean vs glpsol residuals)**
- 6 scenarios routed from retired glpsol to HiGHS
- `coal_co2_limit` goldens regenerated against alt-optima
- `cost-penalty` goldens regenerated (HiGHS-clean zeros vs glpsol residuals)
- `multi_year_wind_no_investment` `unit_capacity` golden regenerated
- 5 alt-optima goldens regenerated against canonical LP column ordering
- `test_a_lot` + `5weeks_battery_intraperiod_blocks` alt-optima goldens regenerated
- 3 + 4 `summary_solve.csv` goldens regenerated (HiGHS precision + chronological Investment-factor order)
- `hyphenated_entity_names` regen documented
- `tests/REGEN_LOG` documents Phase-2 candidate verification (1 regen + 5 flags)
- Test infrastructure handles two-row-header / `Unnamed:` CSV forms

**Surface A audit fixtures + tests**
- Base fixtures for loader / constraint / objective audit
- 50 focused loader tests for Surface A audit
- 24 model-run constraint tests for B.1–B.15
- 13 cost-term isolation tests for B.16–B.20
- `step_duration=3` derived-fixture regression guards
- Hand-computed `step_duration` LP objective tests
- `engine_polars/scaling`: two-sided guard on `user_bound_scale` recommendation
- `engine_polars`: cascade-vs-seed parity diagnostic

**`plot_outputs` performance**
- `_plot_simple_bars` vectorised; `FixedLocator` / `FixedFormatter` for bar tick axes
- `_sum_row_heights` vectorised
- Stacked & grouped bar paths vectorised
- Sub-pixel-wide bars skipped in draw path
- Single-level expand groups counted in pagination
- Stale on-disk plans invalidated via `schema_version`
- Phantom NaN rows/cols dropped after dim-rule pivot

**Other**
- `native_run_model`: write `timeline_matching_map.csv` from returned dict
- GUI: stable input-source numbering with orphan reuse + visual marker; source-number suffix always written in output folder names
- GUI: ResultViewer style overrides scoped to its own plot tree
- GUI: status / peak / timestamp columns widened in jobs tree
- `tests/scenarios` wired to `engine_polars` cascade

## Release 3.35.0 (13.5.2026) — Cascade memory + GUI font system + plot performance

Performance, GUI and developer-experience release on top of 3.34.0. Long cascade runs no longer balloon RSS across rolls; the GUI handles per-monitor DPI scaling and user-tunable font sizes; `dump_csvs` no longer writes 7 GB debug oracles by default. Includes preparatory work for the engine-wide dtype refactor (axis-vocabulary discovery + canonical `pl.Enum`s) — the end-of-load Enum sweep was activated and then parked in the same release as a precaution.

**Cascade memory**
- Scaling diagnostic gated to once per base solve — 38 % wall-clock speedup on large cascades
- Opt-in `tracemalloc` + RSS checkpoints to localise OOM phases (env-var gated)
- `libc.malloc_trim` called after heavy allocators — 38 % RSS drop
- Heap trimmed at end of each iter too (multi-roll heap accumulation)
- `dump_csvs`: skip 7 GB-scale CSVs by default; env var restores the debug oracle

**dtype refactor — preparatory**
- Phase 1+2: axis-vocabulary discovery + canonical `pl.Enum`s
- Phase 3+4+5 (partial): `load_flextool` end-of-load `pl.Enum` sweep — activated, then disabled in the same release as a guard while downstream fallout was understood
- Dtype-flexible scratch frames in `engine_polars` (preparatory for Enum activation)
- `cast_dim` helper + populated-branch alignment; `cast_dim` sweep across cascade (3 files + remainder)
- `process_outputs`: normalise enum/utf8 join keys in `_entity_all_capacity`

**Path B (rolling-handoff perf)**
- Rolling-handoff CSV reads deduplicated (Path B, Category A)
- `WriterSnapshot` for top-7 per-solve preprocessing (Path B, Cat B)
- `ctx` threaded through period/branch helpers + `_dt_period_active_steps` + `dtttdt`

**GUI font + DPI system**
- Phase 1: centralised font metrics in `ui_metrics.py`
- Phase 2: per-role named fonts via `setup_fonts`
- Phase 3: saved geometry + sash clamped on restore
- Phase 4: rescale saved positions by font metric on restore
- Phase 5: Reset window layout action
- Phase 6: em-ified dialog widths
- Phase 7 + 7c: user-tunable UI font size + UX size tweaks
- Phase 8: per-monitor DPI font rescale
- Header fonts bound to named fonts so live size changes propagate

**Other**
- `engine_polars`: respect `solve.new_stepduration` in `apply_derived_a`
- `engine_polars`: preserve legacy entity-level rows in `dump_csvs` slices
- `engine_polars`: native `p_inflow` override in `apply_derived_a` disabled (regression guard)
- `engine_polars`: end-of-load `FlexData → Enum` cast disabled (preparatory work parked)
- `tests`: `pbt_node_inflow` multi-`time_start` + parent-period fixtures (Phase C)

## Release 3.34.0 (12.5.2026) — Multi-solver support + documentation overhaul

This release ships the two user-facing additions on top of 3.33.0's engine swap: per-solve commercial-solver selection and a documentation refresh organised around the Spine Toolbox GUI as the primary FlexTool interface.

**Multi-solver support**
- New per-solve parameters (v52 migration) on the `solve` entity: `solver`, `solver_io_api`, `solver_options`, `solver_time_limit`, `solver_mip_gap`, `solver_threads`, `solver_log_level`. HiGHS remains the default — existing scenarios with no solver parameters are unaffected.
- Backends supported via [polar-high](https://pypi.org/project/polar-high/): **HiGHS** (default, ships with FlexTool), **Gurobi**, **CPLEX**, **Xpress**, **COPT**. Each commercial solver requires its own Python wrapper + license; FlexTool itself never imports the commercial wrappers and never inspects licenses (vendor's discovery path handles it).
- The three convenience knobs (`solver_time_limit`, `solver_mip_gap`, `solver_threads`) are normalised across solvers; FlexTool translates them to each backend's native parameter name. `solver_options` passes raw key/value pairs through unchanged.
- Cascade startup probes each available solver with a trivial 1-var LP and logs a per-solver license status line, e.g. `Solver license status: gurobi=licensed, cplex=licensed, xpress=licensed, copt=not-installed, highs=licensed`.
- Cold rebuilds in the cascade dispatch through `polar_high.solvers.solve(...)` and normalise the result via a new `LiteSolution` adapter so downstream output writers stay unchanged. Warm-start and Lagrangian decomposition remain HiGHS-only by polar-high design — selecting another solver on a warm cascade logs a warning and falls back to cold rebuilds; selecting another solver on a Lagrangian-decomposed scenario raises a clear configuration error.
- Per-solver documentation pages under `docs/solvers/` (install, licensing, common errors, how to set the solver in FlexTool).

**Documentation overhaul**
- Site reorganised around the Spine Toolbox GUI as the primary FlexTool interface; CLI flows are documented but no longer the default story.
- New developer guide and how-to recipes for the engine_polars-era codebase.
- `decomposition_method` parameter description tightened; superseded GUI screenshot removed.

**Bug fixes**
- `_writer_mid_sets.derive_commodity_node_co2` no longer crashes with `ComputeError: cannot compare string with numeric type (f64)` on customer DBs where `p_commodity.csv`'s value column is inferred as Float64 by polars. `_read_csv` now forces every column to Utf8 on read via `infer_schema_length=0`.
- `process_outputs.calc_storage_vre` no longer raises `KeyError` when `node_self_discharge_loss` is authored on nodes that have no `v_state` LP variable (supply-curve / commodity nodes). The self-discharge multiply is now restricted to the intersection of authored nodes and storage nodes.
- CLI cascade exception handler distinguishes `FlexToolUserError` (configuration problem — clean message, exit 1) from other exceptions (real flextool bug — full traceback). Users hitting unknown-solver / missing-license errors no longer see a stack trace.
- `update_flextool` now refreshes declared dependencies for editable installs too — `pip install -e .` with new core deps in `pyproject.toml` would previously be missed, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` on the next solver invocation. The `--upgrade` is now passed without `--upgrade-strategy=eager` so transitive dependencies aren't churned.

**Performance**
- Spine DB read: `SolveConfig.load_from_db_url` and `TimelineConfig.load_from_db_url` now pre-warm with `db.fetch_all("entity")` + `db.fetch_all("parameter_value")` before any `find_*` call, mirroring the legacy `FlexToolRunner.__init__` pattern. Measured 5.5–6.4× speedup on large customer DBs (~1.8 s saved per cascade run); sub-MB test DBs see no change.

**Other**
- v52 schema migration renames the legacy `solver` value list to `solvers` in place: members expanded from `[glpsol, highs, cplex]` to `[highs, gurobi, cplex, xpress, copt]`; pre-existing `solve.solver = "glpsol"` values are rewritten to `"highs"` (GLPK retired in Δ.22). Parameter_definition foreign key is preserved through the rename so no data is lost.

## Release 3.33.0 (12.5.2026) — `glpsol` retired; HiGHS via `polar-high` becomes the sole LP backend

This release closes out the largest architectural change since FlexTool went open source: the GLPK/GMPL pipeline that built the LP via `glpsol`, wrote MPS files to disk, and re-loaded them into HiGHS is gone.  The new path builds the LP in process via [`polar-high`](https://pypi.org/project/polar-high/) on top of the [`polars`](https://pola.rs/) DataFrame engine, hands it to HiGHS through `highspy`, and stays in memory for the entire solve → handoff → output-writer chain.

There are no binary build artefacts left to ship: `glpsol` is gone, the `bin/glpsol*` binaries that the previous releases bundled have been deleted, and the `flextool.mod` GMPL model file is deleted.  FlexTool is now a pure-Python install — `pip install flextool` is sufficient.

The version is held at 3.x rather than bumped to 4.0.0 until the new engine reaches full parity with the old one across the test suite.  A 4.0.0 semantic bump will follow once that bar is met; this release ships the backend swap behind the existing 3.x API surface.

**Breaking changes**
- `bin/glpsol*` removed; `flextool/flextool.mod` and `flextool/flextool_base.dat` removed
- `--engine=gmpl` hard-rejected with a clear retirement banner
- Legacy GMPL-pipeline CLI flags removed: `--use-old-raw-csv`, `--ipm`, `--auto-scale`, `--relax-feasibility`, `--glpsol-timing`, `--report-near-duplicates`
- The stubbed `flextool/flextoolrunner/lagrangian.py` (legacy GMPL coordinator) is deleted; `--decomposition lagrangian` now drives the native polars coordinator (see below)
- `--highs-threads` accepted as a no-op stub for GUI/Toolbox compat; the native cascade is single-threaded

**New solver backend (`engine_polars`)**
- Whole-system `FlexData` is built directly from a Spine DB or pre-staged workdir CSVs; the LP build, solve, and output handoff all happen in memory through `engine_polars.run_chain_from_db`
- HiGHS is consulted via `polar-high.Problem` / `WarmProblem` / `LagrangianProblem`; no MPS roundtrip
- New experimental `--fast-single-solve` CLI path for simple single-solve workloads — bypasses `write_input` entirely and reads inputs from Spine via `SpineDbReader`
- Native `engine_polars/_writer_*` ports of 150+ preprocessing sets and calculated parameters (Writer Phase 1-4: `L0-L9`, follow-ups 1-8, closeout, Phase 2 sub-dispatches 1-8, Phase 3 cascade adoption, Phase 4 Gap F handoff)
- Automatic LP scaling — analyser, scaling-report, two-sided cost-band guard, geometric-centering fallback, objective and bound scaling
- Δ.31: in-memory `FlexData` + `solution` threaded into `process_outputs.write_outputs` so the output writers no longer round-trip through `solve_data/*.csv`

**Spatial Lagrangian decomposition — native rewire**
- `--decomposition lagrangian` CLI rewired onto `engine_polars._lagrangian.solve_lagrangian`: per-region builds via `LagrangianProblem`, damped subgradient outer loop, primal averaging on the cross-region pipeline flows
- Smoke-test coverage on the LH2 three-region fixture pins the CLI contract within a 2 % gap-to-monolithic tolerance

**Flex-temporal decomposition** (carried over from `new-outputs` 3.29.0, fully integrated)
- Per-entity temporal blocks make mixed-resolution dispatch possible (hourly power + daily hydrogen in the same solve)
- `v50` + `v51` migrations land `solve.new_stepduration` and group-level `new_stepduration` + `decomposition_method`
- Constraints made block-aware: storage, conversion, flow capacity, DC flow, UC, ramp, profile, reserve; node balance generalised via overlap-set aggregation
- Output writers expand coarse-block variables back onto the fine timeline for the user

**Test infrastructure**
- Layer-1/2/3 test pyramid scaffolded, with golden objectives pinned on 10 scenarios and per-scenario timing budgets
- `@pytest.mark.solver` and `@pytest.mark.smoke` markers
- GitHub Actions CI on the smoke tier
- LH2 three-region JSON fixture + per-fixture native parity tests
- MPS-parity harness retired alongside the GMPL pipeline

**Packaging / installation**
- All binary dependencies retired — FlexTool is now a pure-Python install
- `polar-high` is now a core dependency (was an optional `engine-polars` extra)
- `pip install flextool` is sufficient on Linux, macOS, and Windows (HiGHS arrives via the `highspy` wheel)
- PyPI release in preparation (see `specs/pypi_release_checklist.md` for the remaining steps)

---

## Release 3.32.0 (5.5.2026)
**Bug fixes**
- Excel template link-sheet retention: drop link sheets where the link's own class has no surviving data (e.g. `connection_node` when `constraint` is unselected)
- `group.{include_stochastics, new_stepduration}` retagged from `model`/`timeline` to `solve_advanced`
- `timeset.{timeset_weights, representative_period_weights}` retagged to `solve_advanced`
- Quadratic linear scan in `blocks::derive_blocks::_assign_entity_to_group` replaced with a precomputed `(entity → group)` lookup

**New features**
- `--groups` CLI flag on `cmd_export_to_tabular` to restrict the Excel template to a parameter-group set; sheets with no surviving columns are dropped
- GUI parameter-group picker on "Add empty FlexTool input Excel" — DB-driven checkbox tree, required groups (`timeline`, `model`, `solve_basics`, `basics`) highlighted with hover tooltip; theme-aware colours
- Default-value row in v2 Excel sheets where any parameter on the sheet has a default (Map/Array defaults stringified)
- Representative-period clustering input drops scalar-valued profiles/inflows

**Note** — `new-outputs` also landed four hot-path optimisations on the legacy `flextool/flextoolrunner/preprocessing/*` writers (`is_static` fast-path on `PdtLookup`, sparse-emit + `default 0` on the six dense `pdt*` CSVs, `pandas.read_csv` swap in `_read_pdt_at_param`, sparse iteration in `pssdt_varCost_*`, the O(N²×T²) → O(N + |pairs|) fix on `node_inflow_scaling_params.has_node_time_inflow`, and side-node indexing for `process_arc_unions::write_node_group_dispatch_sets`).  Those edits target a code path that the `engine_polars` writer port (Writer Phase 1-4) is retiring, so they were not carried across in the merge — the performance lessons are preserved as actionable items for the native polars writers in `specs/sparse_writer_lessons_for_engine_polars.md`.

## Release 3.2.0 (23.8.2023)
**Bug fixes**
- Storage state, unit flows and ramps were not properly limited in multi-period investment models.
- Removed limits from vq_state (they were causing infeasibilities in some case).
- Added time changing efficiency to profile based flows.
- Flows from node to unit in unit__node are marked negative (were positive).

**New features**
- *Breaking change*: `realized_periods` (solve objects) is supplemented with a `realized_invest_periods` so that the user can state from which solves the results should take investment results and from which solves dispatch results.
- New parameters for solve objects: `solve_mode`, `rolling_duration`, `rolling_solve_horizon`, `rolling_solve_jump` and `rolling_start_time` that enable to build rolling window models. See [How to use a rolling window for a dispatch model](how_to.md#how-to-use-a-rolling-window-for-a-dispatch-model).
- New parameter `contains_solves` that enables nesting solves inside solves (e.g. to calculate shadow values for long term storages or to implement rolling dispatch inside a multi-year investment model). See [How to use Nested Rolling window solves (investments and long term storage)](how_to.md#how-to-use-nested-rolling-window-solves-investments-and-long-term-storage).
- New outputs: For groups: `VRE_share_t`. For unit__nodes (VRE units): `curtailment_share`, `curtailment_share_t`.
- Name changes to outputs: `flow` to `flow_annualized`, `sum_flow` to `sum_flow_annualized`.
- Add migration for results database (parameter descriptions can be migrated).
- Documentation updates: new how-to sections.
- Faster outputting of ramp results.
- update_flextool.py will leave the Toolbox project untouched.
- Disable execute project button from the FlexTool workflow.

## Release 3.1.4 (14.6.2023)
**Bug fixes**
- Cancelling of plot_results will not freeze Toolbox

**New features**
- Lifetime_method (reinvest_automatic and reinvest_choice) so that user can choose whether assets will be automically renewed at the end of lifetime or the model has to make that choice
- Commercial solver support (CPLEX)
- Database migration. init.sqlite and input_data.sqlite will be updated to the latest version when update_flextool.py is run. It is also possible to update any database using migrate_database.py. After `git pull`, run `python -m update_flextool.py`. In future, just `python -m update_flextool.py` is sufficient. Best to update Spine Toolbox before doing this.

## Release 3.1.3 (1.6.2023)
**Bug fixes**
- Use of capacity margin caused an infeasibility
- Certain inflow time series settings crashed the model (complained about ptNode[n, 'inflow', t])
- Investments did not consider lifetime correctly - units stayed in the system even after lifetime ended
- Lifetime is now calculated using years_represented
- Fixed how retirements work over multiple solves

**New features**
- Added support for commercial solvers (CPLEX explicitly at this point)


## Release 3.1.2 (23.5.2023)
**Bug fixes**
- Node prices were million times smaller than they should have been (bug introduced when scaling the model in 3.1.0)
- Non-synchronous limit was not working.

**New features**
- Documentation structure was improved
- Model assumes precedence between storage_start_end_method, storage_binding_method, and storage_solve_horizon_method (in that order)


## Release 3.1.1 (13.5.2023)

**Bug fixes**
- The calculation of the p_entity_max_capacity did not consider which investment method was actually active. It also limited capacity in situations where investment method was supposed to be 'invest_no_limit'.


## Release 3.1.0 (13.5.2023)

**Bug fixes**
- Division by zero capacity for units with cf
- Output fixed costs for existing units
- Fix output calculation for annualized fixed costs
- Fix error in importing CO2_methods for groups
- Add other_variable_cost for flows from unit to sink

**New features**
- New investment method with a limited horizon (model used to assume infinite horizon)
  - *Braking change*: new parameter 'years_represented', which replaces 'discount_years'. It is a map to indicate how many years the period represents before the next period in the solve. Used for discounting. Can be below one (multiple periods in one year). Index: period, value: years.
- Added sidebar to documentation (gh-pages branch)
- Default solver changed from GLPSOL to HiGHS
- Documentation improvements
- Scaling of the model resulting in very big performance improvement for linear problems
- Improved plotting for the web browser version
- In Spine Toolbox, plotting is based on the specification from the browser version
- More results: group flows over time
- More results: costs for whole model run
- More result plots

## Release 3.0.1 (17.3.2023)

**Bug fixes**
- CO2_method for groups was not imported correctly from Excel inputs
- Fix other_variable_cost in units for flows from unit to sink (source to unit was working)

**New features**
- Output fixed costs for existing units
- Added outputs to show average capacity factors for periods
